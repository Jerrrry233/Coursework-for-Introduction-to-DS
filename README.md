# Introduction to the Lunar Effect on News Sentiment

## **Introduction**
This project explores the influence of lunar phases on news sentiment using sentiment analysis techniques and statistical tests. By combining astronomical data with textual sentiment analysis, it examines how emotions reflected in news vary across moon phases and news categories.

---

## **Research Questions**
1. Do different moon phases (New Moon, First Quarter, Full Moon, Last Quarter) affect news sentiment?
2. Do different moon phases influence sentiment across various news categories?
3. Is there a pattern in news sentiment based on the lunar cycle?

---

## **Key Findings**
- No significant differences were observed in factual or analytical categories such as "BUSINESS" and "POLITICS."
- - Lunar phases significantly impact sentiment in emotionally driven categories like "ENTERTAINMENT" and "WELLNESS," aligning with traditional views of the Moon's influence on emotions.
- Temporal patterns suggest stronger negative sentiment during New Moon and Full Moon phases, particularly in 2019–2020, possibly linked to global events like COVID-19.

## **Instructions for Running the Code**
1. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Download the news category dataset from Kaggle and update the file path in the R script to match your system.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jerrrry233/Coursework-for-Introduction-to-DS.git

3. **Install R and Required Packages**:
   - Ensure R and RStudio are installed on your system.
   - Install the necessary R packages, including tidyverse, ggplot2, jsonlite, PMCMRplus, and textdata.

4. **Download the Dataset**:
    Download the news category dataset from Kaggle and update the file path in the R script to match your system, as the current path reflects theauthor’s local directory.

6.  **Run the Script**:
   - Open DDDDDDSSSS course work_R.R in RStudio.
   - Run the script step-by-step to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and sentiment analysis.
